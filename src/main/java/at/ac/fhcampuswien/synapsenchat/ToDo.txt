ToDo:
    - CHAT SERIALIZATION NOT WORKING CORRECTLY!!!
    - Create dedicated Sender and Receiver Classes for MessageManager!
    - Connect MessageHandling to GUI! (currently using console)
    - Multi chat ? (More than one client connecting to the server)
    - letting client reconnect to server after connection is lost without having to restart both components!!

Fixme:
    - Threads don't terminate if Server or Client closes the session!!! (using "terminate" variable to let parent thread know when to exit.)
    - Cleanup Code in "connection" package

BUG:
    - Some...

DONE:
    - Server and Client create their own Chat object, saving received and sent messages on their own.
    - Server and Client should start in a new Thread with creating a new Chat object.
    - A chat should serve as the communication link between the server and the client.
    - Chat logic. Each message object should be assigned to a chat.
    - Create server or client instances from Chat ---> new Chat(chatName, Server || Client)
    - Serialization of Chat object with all sent messages.
