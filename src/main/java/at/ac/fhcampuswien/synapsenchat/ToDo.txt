ToDo:
    - Chat logic. Each message object should be assigned to a chat.
    - A chat should serve as the communication link between the server and the client, accessible to both.
    - Multi chat ? (More than one client connecting to the server)
    - letting client reconnect to server after connection is lost without having to restart both components.

Fixme:
    - Threads don't terminate if Server or Client closes the session!!! (using "terminate" variable to let parent thread know when to exit.)
    - Cleanup Code in "connection" package

BUG:
    - Chats cannot be used from client and server
    FIX: Letting the server create a chat and manage the messages. only incoming and outgoing messages to and from the server are stored!!!!

DONE:
    - Serialization of Chat object with all sent messages.
