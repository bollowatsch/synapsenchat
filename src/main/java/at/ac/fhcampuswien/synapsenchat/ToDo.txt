ToDo:
    - Chat logic. Each message object should be assigned to a chat.
    - A chat should serve as the communication link between the server and the client, accessible to both.

Fixme:
    - Threads don't terminate if Server or Client closes the session.
    - Multichat ? (More than one Client connecting to the server)
    - Cleanup Code in "connection" package
